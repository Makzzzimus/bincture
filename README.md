## 🌟Future of the project
From the start of development, this project was planned as a tiny toy to get in touch with the C programming language and low-level development overall. Indeed, **this project isn't meant for professional or day-to-day use**. But still, I would appreciate all feedback and repo stars! As a toy project **it isn't planned to receive any future updates**. Despite this, I have some ideas for new features and overall improvements. Maybe someday, I will return to the project, update it, or completely rewrite it from scratch.
